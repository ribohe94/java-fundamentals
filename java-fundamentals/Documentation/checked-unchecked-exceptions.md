## Checked
Are the exceptions that are checked at compile time. If some code within a method throws a checked exception, then the method must either handle the exception or it must specify the exception using throws keyword.

## Unchecked
Unchecked Exception in Java is those Exceptions whose handling is NOT verified during Compile time. These exceptions occurs because of bad programming. The program wonâ€™t give a compilation error. All Unchecked exceptions are direct sub classes of RuntimeException class.
