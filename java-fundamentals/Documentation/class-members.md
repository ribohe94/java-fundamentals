# Class members
Class members can be divided in two sections, class variables and class methods.
## Class variables
Fields that have the static modifier in their declaration are called static fields or class variables. They have to be differentiated from instance variables (That do not have the static modifier) since these, as the name implies, only exist in instances of the object.

The Java programming language supports static methods as well as static variables. Static methods, which have the static modifier in their declarations, should be invoked with the class name, without the need for creating an instance of the class
