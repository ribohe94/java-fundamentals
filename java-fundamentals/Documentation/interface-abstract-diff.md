## Abstract Class
Abstract classes are classes that contain one or more abstract methods. An abstract method is a method that is declared, but contains no implementation. These classes cannot be instantiated and require sub-classes to inherit their components.
## Interface
An Interface is like a contract, it accepts that it will have certain inputs and outputs. What does this mean? This means that Interfaces only have the signatures of functions and the programmer will have to build their body (They are declared, but have no implementation).

|Abstract Class|Interface|
|----|----|
|Abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods.|	Interface can have only abstract methods.|
|Abstract class doesn't support multiple inheritance.|Interface supports multiple inheritance.|
|Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables.|Interface has only static and final variables.|
|Abstract class can have static methods, main method and constructor.|Interface can't have static methods, main method or constructor.|
|Abstract class can provide the implementation of interface.|Interface can't provide the implementation of abstract class.|
|The abstract keyword is used to declare abstract class.|	The interface keyword is used to declare interface.|
